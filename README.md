# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### dependency

This app uses a minimal number of dependencies and it's axios (for fetching) and firebase (database and deploy).
I have tried not to use too many dependencies for this project, just to keep it simple.

### Responsive design

This app is fully responsive.
